## Implement these functions using recursion. Recursion is the act of a function
## calling itself.

fib <- function(n) {
  # TODO: return the nth fibonacci number "F_n".
  # The fibonacci numbers are defined as F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2), where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.
  n
}

fac <- function(n) {
  # TODO: return the factorial of n, or "n!"
  # The factorial is defined as follows:
  # 1! = 1
  # n! = n * (n-1)!
  # You are not allowed to use a built-in function for doing this.
  n
}
