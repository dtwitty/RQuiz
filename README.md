# R Programming Quiz

This repo is a programming quiz in R.
It consists of a bunch of test cases and function skeletons.

The functions in this quiz should be implemented from scratch. Many functions
can be implemented using built-in functions or with a quick Google search.
However, the goal is to learn programming, not blindly pass test cases.

## Instructions

Fork this repository, fill in the function stubs, and submit a pull request back
to this repo.
The test cases can be run by sourcing "quiz.r"
The test cases depend on the "testthat" library.

Functions should be carefully written to be extremely readable. They should be
liberally commented, well-formatted, and exhibit a consistent personal style.

The instructions involve a pull request so that I can then provide code review.
