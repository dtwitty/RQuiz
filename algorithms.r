## This file asks you to implement some well-known algorithms.
## There are probably built-in functions or versions available on sites like
##   Rosetta Code, but the point is not to use them.
## The point of these is to be able to go from an english description of the
## algorithm to working code.

bubble.sort <- function(v) {
  ## TODO: Given a vector v, sort its contents in ascending order using the 
  ## "Bubble Sort" algorithm.
  
  ## Bubble sort is a simple algorithm. Look at every pair of adjacent elements
  ## of v. If the left side is bigger than the right side, swap the two. Repeat
  ## this process until the list is sorted.
  v
}

binary.search <- function(v, e) {
  ## TODO: given a sorted vector v, determine if e is in v using binary search.
  
  ## Binary search works like this:
  ## If the list is empty, return FALSE
  ## Look at the middle index of the list, m.
  ## If v[m] = e, then return TRUE.
  ## If v[m] is more than e, look at the first half of the list.
  ## Otherwise, look at the second half of the list.
  ## Repeat this process recursively until you either find e or you

  FALSE
